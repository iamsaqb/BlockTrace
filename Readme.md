# BlockTrace

## Project Description

BlockTrace is a transparent participant registration smart contract built using Solidity. The contract allows users to register themselves immutably on-chain, enables the contract owner to manage data, and records key lifecycle details from deployment.

## Project Vision

BlockTrace aims to serve as a model for simple, self-contained, and fully on-chain registration and participation tracking. It eliminates manual entry and off-chain dependencies, allowing for open verification, on-chain ownership management, and decentralized event tracking.

## Key Features

- **No-input registration:** Any user can register on-chain with a single call.
- **Participant tracking:** Track and count all registered participants for transparent statistics.
- **Ownership management:** Owner can reset registration data or transfer ownership without outside input.
- **Contract lifecycle info:** Get the age of the contract in block numbers, supporting event analysis and system monitoring.

## Future Scope

- Integrate with web frontends for real-time dashboards.
- Add advanced event logging for actions and registration changes.
- Expand participant functionality (roles/badges or project milestones).
- Support cross-project/event registration from a single contract instance.
- Optionally add on-chain analytics or proof-of-participation NFTs.
